- I want medium steak, then it should be removed from the sous vide machine at **58 celsius**, or the machine temperature limit should be set to **58 celsius**.
If consider the searing part, maybe set to **56 celsius**, so there is some headroom left for the searing heat.

- How long should a 200gram steak cook?
1hour cooking, so the heat penetrate the steak properly.

- How long should a 1.25KG / 2 inches steak cook?
Then it's around 2-3 hours sous vide cooking.

- What about seasoning?
salt and pepper generously, all sides.
Add aromatics.

- What about searing?
    high-temperature tolerant oil to sear the steak.
    with a lot of butter, it's for bathing the steak, when butter melts.
    And the garlic and aromatics in the butter bath to give more flavor.
